# Theory

- **a) How can one deduce the secant method from Newton's method?**

  - If you replace the derivative in Newton's method with an approximation, you get the secant method.

- **b) Will Newton's method always converge to a zero?**

  - No. If you reach a flat line the calculations will send you to infinity and into an inifite loop.

- **c) If no derivative is available, which method should you choose - Newton's method or the secant method?**

  - Secant method, as Newton's method requires a derivative.

- **d) Which method is the safest to use - Newton's method, the secant method or the bisection method?**

  - I would say bisection is the safest as it **will** converge, though it is the slowest one (next question).

- **e) Which method is the slowest to use - Newton's method, the secant method or the bisection method?**

  - Bisection method time > Secant method time > Newton's method time.
